## What is a Noahide
A Noahide is a non-jew (gentile) who observes the 7 Noahide laws of the Torah and is a believer in the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

The 7 laws are:
1. ***Avodah Zarah*** Not to worship idols.
1. ***Birkat HaShem*** Not to curse God.
1. ***Sheficat Damim*** Not to commit murder.
1. ***Gilui arayot*** Not to commit adultery or sexual immorality.
1. ***Gezel*** Not to steal.
1. ***Ever Min HaChay*** Not to eat flesh torn from a living animal.
1. ***Dinim*** To establish courts of justice.

Other names for Noahides are B'Nei Noach (Children of Noah), Righteous Gentile or Noachide.

## What is the difference between Judaism and Noahidism?
Noahidism is a covenant made by G-d with humanity as a whole, whereas Judaism is a convenant made with the jews only.

Judaism holds the rabbi as the authority on Jewish law, and the synagogue is the place of worship. In Noahidism, there is no such authority, place of worship or organization.

Judaism and Noahidism are not separate faiths, but rather are both the same faith, with Judaism being for jews and Noahidism for non-jews.

## How do I know if Noahidism is right for me?
It would be a mistake to assume that since there are only 7 commandments, Noahidism is an "easier" faith to practice than Judaism. When in fact there are 7 categories of commandments within the 7 commandments.

For example, **Not to worship idols** means that you could never step into a Christian church or carry a Christian bible, unless under life-threatening circumstances.

Because Noahidism is for the non-jew and the majority of texts in Judaism are for jews, this means that there will be many texts that are either forbidden or inappropriate to non-jews. This puts severe limitations on what Noahides can practice and read.

For some, conversion to Judaism may not be an option due to practical considerations, or may not be desirable to those who want to conserve their national identity. Therefore if one's mother is not jewish, Noahidism is the best option.

Finally, Noahidism is relatively new unexplored territory. There is a lot of material out there on the web under the banner of "Noahidism" and it will be difficult to sift through what is acceptable in the eyes of HaShem, and what is not.

## What happens if I decide not to be a Noahide?


## Can a Noahide believe in Jesus?
No. Believing in Jesus would constitute idolatry and would violate one of Noahide laws.

## Why is worshipping Jesus considered idolatry?
The doctrine of the Trinity claims that god is 3 persons and that one of those persons is a man. This is the worst kind of idolatry in that it involves worshipping something *other* than G-d, and worshipping a creation.

Deuteronomy 4:16
> Lest you become corrupt and make for yourselves a graven image, the representation of any form, the likeness of male or female,

Numbers 23:19
> God is not a man that He should lie, nor is He a mortal that He should relent. Would He say and not do, speak and not fulfill?

Isaiah 42:8
> I am the Lord, that is My Name; and My glory I will not give to another, nor My praise to the graven images.

Deuteronomy 4:35
> You have been shown, in order to know that the Lord He is God; there is none else besides Him.

Deuteronomy 4:39
> And you shall know this day and consider it in your heart, that the Lord He is God in heaven above, and upon the earth below; there is none else.


The majority of Christendom subscribes to the doctrine of the Trinity.

## What about non-trinitarian (unitarian) Christians?
Unitarian Christians are not considered idolaters since they recognize that there is one G-d. However their claims of Jesus being the messiah are heretical.

## What should a Noahide read/study aside from the Torah?
- [The Divine Code](https://asknoah.org/books/the-divine-code) by Rabbi Moshe Weiner


## Can a Noahide study Talmud?
Yes, but he/she can only study the parts that are relevant to the Noahide laws and cannot study the Talmud in an in-depth manner.

## Does a Noahide have to eat kosher?
No, but he/she must not eat flesh torn from a living animal.

## Can a Noadhide keep Shabbat?
No, it is forbidden for a Noahide to keep Shabbat (the sabbath) as that is the inheritance **only** to the jews given by G-d.

A Noahide cannot create for him/herself a "holy day" of religious observance similar to Shabbat, since this would be considered adding a new commandment, which is prohibited.

## What is the relationship between Judaism/Noahidism and Zionism?

## Can a Noahide participate in holiday traditions?
Yes, he can participate if he/she has been invited by a Jewish family.
However he/she is forbidden from observing the holy days that are reserved for Jews (such as Passover or Sukkot) as that would be creating a new religion for him/herself.

## Can a Noahide convert to Judaism, and if they can should I start as a Noahide if I'm interested in converting to Judaism?
