## What is a Noahide
A Noahide is a non-jew (gentile) who observes the 7 Noahide laws of the Torah and is a believer in the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

The 7 laws are:
1. ***Avodah Zarah*** Not to worship idols.
1. ***Birkat HaShem*** Not to curse God.
1. ***Sheficat Damim*** Not to commit murder.
1. ***Gilui arayot*** Not to commit adultery or sexual immorality.
1. ***Gezel*** Not to steal.
1. ***Ever Min HaChay*** Not to eat flesh torn from a living animal.
1. ***Dinim*** To establish courts of justice.

Other names for Noahides are B'Nei Noach (Children of Noah), Righteous Gentile or Noachide.

## What is the difference between Judaism and Noahidism?
Noahidism is a covenant made by G-d with humanity as a whole, whereas Judaism is a convenant made with the jews only.

Judaism holds the rabbi as the authority on Jewish law, and the synagogue is the place of worship. In Noahidism, there is no such authority, place of worship or organization.

Judaism and Noahidism are not separate faiths, but rather are both the same faith, with Judaism being for jews and Noahidism for non-jews.

Both jews and Noahides believe in the 13 principles of faith by Maimonides (the Rambam):
1. God is the cause of existence
2. God is one
3. God is incorporeal
4. God is eternal
5. We serve God exclusively
6. God communicates through prophecy
7. Moses was the ultimate prophet
8. The Torah is of divine origin
9. The Torah is immutable
10. God is omniscient
11. God rewards and punishes
12. We believe in and await the messiah
13. The dead will be resurrected

## How do I know if Noahidism is right for me?
It would be a mistake to assume that since there are only 7 commandments, Noahidism is an "easier" faith to practice than Judaism. When in fact there are 7 categories of commandments within the 7 commandments.

For example, **Not to worship idols** means that you could never step into a Christian church or carry a Christian bible, unless under life-threatening circumstances.

Furthermore, there are some logical commandments that both jews and Noahides are obligated to follow. For example, the commandment **Honor thy father and thy mother** is a commandment that would be logical for Noahides to follow.

Because Noahidism is for the non-jew and the majority of texts in Judaism are for jews, this means that there will be many texts that are either forbidden or inappropriate to non-jews. This puts severe limitations on what Noahides can practice and read.

For some, conversion to Judaism may not be an option due to practical considerations (absence of a synagogue/Rabbi), or may not be desirable to those who want to conserve their national identity. Therefore if one's mother is not jewish, Noahidism might be the best option in such cases.

Finally, Noahidism is not an organized religion and has no central authority. Different groups will have different opinions on issues such as whether Noahides are allowed to study Torah or observe the Sabbath. This unfortunately makes it difficult to discern what is acceptable and what is not.

## What happens if I decide not to be a Noahide?

If a person actively denies the existence of G-d, or any of the fundamental principles of faith in G-d, then this person is a *deviant believer*.

A deviant believer will not receive a part in the World to Come, but instead to the lowest world where the wicked reside.

## Can a Noahide believe in Jesus?
No. Believing in Jesus would constitute idolatry and would violate one of Noahide laws.

## Why is worshipping Jesus considered idolatry?
The doctrine of the Trinity claims that god is 3 persons and that one of those persons is a man. This is the worst kind of idolatry in that it involves worshipping something *other* than G-d, and worshipping a creation.

Deuteronomy 4:16
> Lest you become corrupt and make for yourselves a graven image, the representation of any form, the likeness of male or female,

Numbers 23:19
> God is not a man that He should lie, nor is He a mortal that He should relent. Would He say and not do, speak and not fulfill?

Isaiah 42:8
> I am the Lord, that is My Name; and My glory I will not give to another, nor My praise to the graven images.

Deuteronomy 4:35
> You have been shown, in order to know that the Lord He is God; there is none else besides Him.

Deuteronomy 4:39
> And you shall know this day and consider it in your heart, that the Lord He is God in heaven above, and upon the earth below; there is none else.

Contrast these verses that are clear, explicit and unambiguous with
the usual verses in the New Testament that are used to support the
doctrine of the Trinity, including the [Johannine
Comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannine_Comma).

The majority of Christendom subscribes to the doctrine of the Trinity.

## Aren't you confusing Trinitarianism with Tritheism?





## What about non-trinitarian (unitarian) Christians?
Unitarian Christians are not considered idolaters since they recognize that there is one G-d. However their claims of Jesus being the messiah are heretical.

## How many Noahides are there in the world?

The [Wikipedia article on
Noahidism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noahidism) claims that
approximately 20 000 exist in 2018--however this number is probably difficult to confirm.

## What should a Noahide read/study aside from the Torah?
- [The Divine Code](https://asknoah.org/books/the-divine-code) by Rabbi Moshe Weiner


## Can a Noahide study Talmud?
Yes, but he/she can only study the parts that are relevant to the Noahide laws and cannot study the Talmud in an in-depth manner.

## Does a Noahide have to eat kosher?
No, but he/she must not eat flesh torn from a living animal.

If he/she chooses to eat kosher for practical reasons (such as for
health), it is acceptable as long as it is not for religious reasons
nor with the expectation of any benefit.

## Can a Noadhide keep Shabbat?
No, it is forbidden for a Noahide to keep Shabbat (the sabbath) as that is the inheritance **only** to the jews given by G-d.

A Noahide cannot create for him/herself a "holy day" of religious observance similar to Shabbat, since this would be considered adding a new commandment, which is prohibited.

## What is the relationship between Judaism/Noahidism and Religious Zionism?

## Are believers of Noahidism subordinate to Jews? Are Jews racially superior people with an innate ability to access divinity?

## What are recommended English translations of the Torah and/or the Tanakh?
- [Judaica Press](https://judaicapress.com/collections/rosenberg-rabbi-a-j?usf_sort=title)
- [Art Scroll](https://www.artscroll.com/Categories/BBL.html)

## Can a Noahide participate in holiday traditions?
Yes, he can participate if he/she has been invited by a Jewish family.
However he/she is forbidden from observing the holy days that are reserved for Jews (such as Passover or Sukkot) as that would be creating a new religion for him/herself.

## Can a Noahide convert to Judaism, and if they can should I start as a Noahide if I'm interested in converting to Judaism?

## What are some Noahide resources on the web?
